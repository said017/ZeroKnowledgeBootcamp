# Homework 1

## Maths Introduction

1.  Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}\
    What is\
    a) 4 + 4\
    b) 3 x 5\
    c) what is the inverse of 3?

    Solution:

    a) 4 + 4 = 8 ≡ **1 mod 7**\
    b) 3 x 5 = 15 ≡ **1 mod 7**\
    c) 3^5 = 243 ≡ **5 mod 7**

2.  For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}\
    Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?

    Solution:

    To be considered a group this combination needs to have certain properties:

    - Closure **(YES)**
    - Associativity **(YES)**
    - Identity **(YES)** e = 0
    - Inverse Element **(YES)** \
      Inverse of 1 = 1\
      Inverse of 2 = 4\
      Inverse of 3 = 5\
      Inverse of 4 = 2\
      Inverse of 5 = 3\
      Inverse of 6 = 6

3.  What is -13 mod 5?

    Solution:

    5 (-3) + (x) = -13\
    -15 + x = -13\
    x = **2**

## Use Cases

In your groups, think of some use cases of zero knowledge proofs What problems are there when using zkps in real world situations ?

Solution :

Private transactions, sensitive private information data (such as medical records, DNA etc.)
